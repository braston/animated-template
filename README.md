*Udemy Javascript Web Project #6*  

In this project I learned about customizing the content of an existing CSS template and animating the results

*Fundamentals covered:*

-  Using and modifying Tailwind CSS templates
-  Add random user images, as well as unsplash images
-  Modify font awesome icons
-  Implement scroll animation using the "Animate On Scroll" library
-  Adding external script using async and defer to optimize HTML parsing. 3 Scripts set to defer to ensure HTML displays prior to download
-  Code review regarding placement of <script> tags towards bottom, ONLY on top if critical
